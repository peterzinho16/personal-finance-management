/* Override @font-face for Bootstrap Icons when local fonts are missing.
   Reason: The minified bootstrap-icons.css refers to relative "fonts/" path
   which may not exist in this project structure. This override points to
   the official CDN-hosted font files. If you later host fonts locally,
   remove this file and place fonts at a path that matches the CSS. */
